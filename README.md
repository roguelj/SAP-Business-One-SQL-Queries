# SQL Queries for SAP Business One
This is the repository for the SAP Business One queries featured over at my blog: https://roguelj.co.uk/category/sap-business-one-queries/

## Getting Started
Grab and install a copy of [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017), or [Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/what-is?view=sql-server-2017).
Connect to your server, load in the query and execute.

## Warning!
Please be aware that only SELECT statements are supported by SAP. Any data-modification statements (such as DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE, MERGE) run directly against your SAP Business One database will invalidate your warranty and support.
